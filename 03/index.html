    <h1>Cat</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>cat (<em>Felis catus</em>)</strong>, also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting–as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.

        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.

    <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
    <p>
        The origin of the English word <em>cat</em>, Old English <em>catt</em>, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.<sup>[6]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.<sup>[8]</sup>

        The English <em>puss</em>, extended as <em>pussy</em> and <em>pussycat</em>, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.<sup>[9][10]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        A male cat is called a <em>tom</em> or <em>tomcat</em><sup>[11]</sup> (or a gib,sup>[12]</sup> if neutered). A female is called a <em>queen</em><sup>[13][14]</sup> (or sometimes a <em>molly</em>,<sup>[15]</sup> if spayed). A juvenile cat is referred to as a <em>kitten</em>. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word <em>catling</em>.<sup>[16]</sup> A group of cats can be referred to as a <em>clowder</em>, a <em>glaring</em>,<sup>[17]</sup> or a <em>colony</em>.<sup>[18]</sup>

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
        The scientific name <em>Felis catus</em> was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.<sup>[1][2]</sup> <em>Felis catus domesticus</em> was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.<sup>[3]</sup> <em>Felis daemon</em> proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.<sup>[19][20]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely <em>Felis catus</em>.<sup>[21][22]</sup> In 2007, the modern domesticated subspecies <em>F. silvestris catus</em> sampled worldwide was considered to have likely descended from the African wildcat (<em>F. lybica</em>), following results of phylogenetic research.<sup>[23][24][a]</sup> In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, <em>Felis catus></em>.<sup>[25]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10 to 15 million years ago.<sup>[26]</sup> The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago.<sup>[27]</sup> Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46 to 16.76 million years ago.<sup>[28]</sup> The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago.<sup>[27]</sup> Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.<sup>[29]</sup> The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes<sup>[30]</sup> and roughly 20,000 genes.<sup>[31]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Domestication</h2>
    <p>
        It was long thought that the domestication of the cat began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC.<sup>[33][34]</sup> However, the earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.<sup>[35]</sup> Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.<sup>[32][36]</sup> Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.<sup>[37]</sup>
